			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h5>Disclaimer: No One Has Asked These Questions</h5>
			<br>
			<h4>WHY DOESN'T THE MOBILE VERSION WORK!?</h4>
			<p>Listen. I'm not the best at this whole html thing, and, from my understanding, adding
mobile to html is more difficult than you may think. I've tried to do it, and kind of found a weird work-around to it,
but it's not gonna cut it. There's no mobile version until I resolve it. ALSO mobile devices are the reason webistes look
generic and stupid now, so there.</p>
			<h4>Why did you do this?</h4>
			<p> I thought it would be cool. I've always had the idea of making a site in the past, and now I know
enough about coding to make one. It'd be a nice place to express myself and put my time into something worthwhile instead
of doing nothing.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Did you make this yourself?</h4>
			<p> Yes :) The whole thing (minus the images of course). I coded the entire website. By hand.
In a Notepad document. With janky HTML code. My hands hurt.
			<br>
			<h4>Why didn't you use a website maker?</h4>
			<p>I wanted it to be genuine. Using a website maker would have been WAY too easy. Also
a lot of them are very cookie-cutter and lack creativity. Plus I REALLY like the Old-Internet aesthetic of HTML. So if
you're wondering why it looks like this, it's by choice.
			<br>
			<h4>How long have you collected games for?</h4>
			<p>I've been playing games all my life. A large chunk of my PS2 collection was
given to me by my dad. Then I got my first game console: My Glacier colored Gameboy Advanced, and a copy of Pokemon Crystal. 
I developed a special interest in video games after playing my childhood games on repeat, watching a lot of YouTube, and watching
my cousin play Nintendo and Sega games. Ever since maybe late elementary school, I've just wanted to play games. I remember the days
of asking my parents to buy me Wii and DS games, and trying out new stuff from the local Family Video. By the time I was in high school,
I racked up a formidable collection. I started collecting retro games by that point too. Then I got my first job, and that's when my collection
started to grow like crazy. I'm also lucky enough to have some close friends that also appreciate my collection, and let me have someone to play them
with. I'm really proud of what I've collected so far, and I'd love to keep expanding it. (Sorry for going on for so long)</p>

			<h4>Huge Basketball Shorts?</h4>
