			<p>I don't normally do this kind of thing anymore. I stopped dumping my thoughts onto social media
because I know people, one, don't want to see it, and two, don't care. I just felt the need to do it today and express what I've
been thinking about lately.</p>
			<p><b>Life has been fucking rough lately, and I've felt more alone than I ever have.</b></p>
			<p>I get it, everyone has had a rough time lately, so there's really no point in me talking about my sorrows, but
here I am doing it anyways. I've never felt more alone than I do right now. It's probably not rocket-science that I don't have many friends to begin with.
My best friend and I try and talk to each other as much as we can, but hanging out hasn't been a thing in a while. Mostly due to the fact that life keeps us busy.
They have a lot going on, and my work schedule is abysmal. My group from high school is the same way, but we honestly only really talk every few days in passing
through messenger.</p>
<p>The biggest blow, socially, is probably from my other best friend. AKA my ex. We were together infrequently, off and on, for almost 6 years. Together or not, we were still best friends.
We broke up for the final time a few months back and agreed this was it. Still agreeing to be best friends of course. Cut to now, where they're with someone else, living with
them a while away from here. We haven't hung out in weeks, and at this point, it doesn't seem like they want to. I get this happens a lot, but we used to do everything together.
Being out in public makes me extremely nervous, and they were the only way I'd go out. Now that it's over, I honestly don't leave my house anymore besides work. I GrubHub food, order
all my shit from Amazon. And the thought of going out in public by myself horrifies me. It feels like I have no one to do anything with anymore. </p>
			<p>As fall comes around too, it makes me miss the idea of doing fall activites with someone. I think of carving pumpkins, going out at night, and
cuddling and watching movies. Being completely honest, I'm one of those people who craves physical affection, and it honestly feels like I'll never get to experience it again. (Not that
I really did before anyways.)</p>
			<p>And yeah. I'm sorry I probably sound like a fucking incel for wanting affection. Because I forgot that men and/or amabs aren't allowed to have feelings, because it's "cringy" and no
one cares. But I legitmatly feel that way and I wish I could do anything to help.</p>
			<p>And that's another thing. I don't know how many people know but <b>I am non-binary</b>. I've been non-binary since 2016. I honestly might even be trans but I don't think that's something
I have the time, and or mental capacity to worry about right now. I have more other things to worry about at this point. My friends know, and some other random people know. (You know now). But I'm pretty sure my parents
don't know. I'm too afraid to tell my mom, and potentially lose the ability to see my sister. I don't think my dad would care but my step-mom may. I'm pronoun indifferent because of not knowing exactly how I feel.</p>
			<p>I honestly want to embrace it more, but I feel like I'm "not non-binary enough". Like everyone still, and will always, see me as a cis male. I fucking hate the thought of being a cis male. 
But I clear as day look like one. No dyed hair. No piercings. No cool clothes. Just a fat, ugly, hairy. Thing. I honestly hate my body hair, and despite the fact that I do have facial hair a lot, I don't like it that much.
I guess it comes with the idea that non-binary people should be androgynous. But I'm not right now. I have other non-binary friends that have come out and beautifully expressed themselves. I'm extremely happy for them, but in a
way it also depresses me, only because I feel like I'll never get to that level. I'll always feel like some sort of poser. I feel like no one will ever respect me as a non-binary person. They'll always just group me in with the
obnoxious, jerkoff, stereotype of cis white men, and it hurts my soul.</p>
			<p>I guess we can talk about some of my other characteristics. I'm a proud satanist as well. Been one for over a year. No, I don't actually worship satan, and kill people, and sacrifice babies and shit. It's non-theistic,
and we use Baphomet as a metaphor. It's not particularly our way to openly express our views without being asked but. I wanted to say that our big fight is for human rights and religious freedom. A big victory recently was the satanic abortion ritual,
which allows satanist to bypass a lot of the bullshit that comes with trying to get an abortion. I'm pro-life so this makes me very happy. But we do fight for religious freedom. Christians shouldn't be given a higher power than other religions, as they
have for hundreds of years. I'm perfectly ok with people worshiping whatever god they want, but if you're a toxic Christian, go fuck yourself, and stop using your religion for hate.</p>
			<p>And speaking of views, let me rattle off a few. I'm not longer associating with republicans. Fuck toxic Christians. If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, or sexist, FUCK YOU.</p> 
			<p>I've been struggling with mental issues lately too. I feel like I've finally realized something is truly wrong. I've dealt with depression, and anxiety, since middle school, (but don't we all).
But recently I feel like those feelings are coming from something else. I don't want to self diagnose myself, but I feel like it might have to do with ADD and/or ADHD. There's also a chance I might be autistic. It probably sounds
stupid but. I feel like I've always been weird, or unlikeable. I was never evaluated as a kid, as my parents say it wasn't a worry of theirs since I was mostly quiet. I've felt like I've been behind on life because of my mental issues.
It honestly sometimes feels like I have a different person controlling my body sometimes. I'm currently in therapy (not very often, and I think he's annoyed by me) but hopefully I'll get this sorted out. We'll see I guess.</p>
			<p>I'm running out of steam writing this. I guess the last thing I want to do is apologize to everyone. I've said something before, but I know that to a lot of my old classmates, or crushes, or coworkers, I've definitely
made an ass out of myself. Made you uncomfortable, or made you think I'm weird, or made you dislike me. I hope you know that it was never my intention to make you unhappy, and I'm deeply sorry. Most of those mistakes are always in my brain, and
I feel like I could never make up for them. I care about you all, honestly. I've never meant to make anyone upset or uncomfortable.</p>
			<p>And on the other side of that coin, if you're a friend of mine, I'm sorry that I ignored you message, or haven't reached out to you in a while, or never followed through with our plans. I don't really have an excuse besides
my brain being fucky, but even that is no excuse. I don't expect forgivness, but I hope that you know that I still care about you and consider you a friend.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I'm really tired. This is all I can type right now. Maybe I'll have more to say later. I'm not saying all this to garner sympathy. Just to get my thoughts out to whoever felt like reading them. </p>
			<p>Love you all <3</p>
